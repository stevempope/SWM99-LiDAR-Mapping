 * 
 * A virtual LiDAR Sensor class.
 * 
 * A virtual LiDAR sensor is produced in place of a real one. This makes it easy to produce reliable test data
 * for our model.
 * 
 * A LiDAR sensor provides our system with two things we care about. The first is the distance data, which
 * assumes one full rotation per sense. To make the sensor more detailed, add more returns. 360 = one read per
 * degree. Distances are assumed to be in Millimetres (mm). 10 mm = 1 cm.
 * 
 * The second is the rotational order of the sensor. Regardless of rotation, the angle of read still counts
 * upwards from 0, but the location of that data in the view and in the model could be flipped had we not recorded
 * it.
